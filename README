Development tips:
- I(Viktor) try to use nide and it looks really cool: http://coreh.github.com/nide/
- Check out how to use node-inspector for debugging
- Always run local.sh instead of run.sh if you want speed! (use a local instance of redis - it's very easy to set up and run)

Notes:
- ./setup.sh must be run to set up the dependencies
- ./run.sh or ./local.sh must be run to turn on the server
- the server will now autorestart on changes
- forgot mobile for now - it's a lot of effort and computation is slow

TODO:
- quitting a game?
- time limit to make a move
- ajax all the things
- benchmark browsers
- replay games
- ability to change scripts/css being loaded inside of the view
