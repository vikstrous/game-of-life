Development tips:
- I(Viktor) try to use nide and it looks really cool: http://coreh.github.com/nide/
- Check out how to use node-inspector for debugging
- Always run local.sh instead of run.sh if you want speed! (use a local instance of redis - it's very easy to set up and run)

Notes:
- ./setup.sh must be run to set up the dependencies
- ./run.sh or ./local.sh must be run to turn on the server
- the server will now autorestart on changes
- forgot mobile for now - it's a lot of effort and computation is slow

TODO (viktor):
- go from ajax to full sockets!!!
- ajax all the other things - profiles, etc.
- time limit to make a move
- replay games
- matchmaking
- rematch
- smoother layout
- benchmark browsers -> give them the option to play bigger game
- webgl shaders!
- preloading system fun stuff?

TODO (greg):
- make rotation of pieces
- make the size of the pieces selector make sense?
- scale pieces down to fit them in the menu
- pregenerate .png images for the pieces (in a sprite sheet? on another server?)
